    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When I read about <a href="http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2012-6636">CVE 2012-6636</a> two things came to my mind: what executable (javascript) code can we inject? and what can we do messing with the xml/json/html etc being transmitted. Thinking for a few minutes and a bigger question arouse: do developers validate their data? I mean, servers can be compromised, traffic intercepted, bugs of all sorts.</p>

<p>So I went on and spend some weeks on this issue. To do so, these are the necessary tools:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html">Android SDK</a> of course</li>
<li><a href="http://mitmproxy.org/">mitmproxy</a> for intercepting requests and responses</li>
<li><a href="code.google.com/p/android-apktool/">Apktool</a> for decompiling the apks</li>
<li><a href="github.com/egirault/googleplay-api.git">Google Play API</a>, which is not an official google api, for downloading some apps</li>
</ul>


<p>First of all, I was interested in Brazilian apps, codded and deployed by brazilian programmers &amp; firms. So, no facebook, whatapps etc.</p>

<p>mitmproxy is pretty cool, cause you can hook a Python script to process all request and responses. mitm attacks normally are employed for grabbing data from the user to the net. Some examples that I found grabbed plaintext passwords, cookies , etc. I was more into using mitmproxy&rsquo;s script engine to alter the response from the server, and watching if the app would complain.</p>

<p>What I have found out ? Not one app validates its data. They all assume that what is received is crystal clear. No bad guy in the middle. I have done three payload examples:</p>

<p>blocking content and displaying a false &ldquo;update your app&rdquo; type of social scan for malware delivery
injecting javascript for the above CVE
changing links to bad guys website</p>

<p>I gave a presentation of these findings in BSides last July. You can check the slides <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/ivanjokerbr/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Oh! Https of course. This is the only way to prevent data manipulation. But even for apps with sensitive data, http transfers are used, and thus, may be a pathway to compromise. So developers, watch out and carry more for your data.</p>
