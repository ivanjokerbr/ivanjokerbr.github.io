    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For this first entry, I have decided to talk about some old work I&rsquo;ve done. Namely, my PhD Thesis. PhD thesis can be very frustrating, you work hard for 3, 4 years just to have some pages stored in a dusty bookshelf and a couple of technical articles published. If you are lucky, perhaps be part of a bigger team that is moving towards something useful. Here in Brazil, and several other places this is the reality, I think.</p>

<p>Back then I wasn&rsquo;t part of any &ldquo;great team&rdquo;, actually it was only me (advisor was a moron), so I tried to do something useful that could last a little longer. Basically, I&rsquo;ve developed a PoC tool for doing static analysis on Java code , that could check for inconsistencies in concurrent models. I based my work on the Ptolemy project (ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu).</p>

<p>If you are curious, check <a href="https://github.com/ivanjokerbr/Miscelanea/blob/master/ivanTheses.pdf?raw=true">here</a> for a copy of the text.</p>

<p>What can I conclude from my work ? 1) Static analysis is hard :&ndash;) 2) A lot of useful checks can be done statically. Regarding code review, these type of tools are a great allie.</p>
